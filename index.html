                Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that
                show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to
                make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She
                starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

                The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of
                evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley
                of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike
                down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My
                brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

                Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while
                I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this
                case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this
                case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

                Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw
                Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit
                to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? 
            </p>

                My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got
                to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot
                that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me
                when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody
                else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

                Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you
                know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most
                times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because
                of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

                Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most
                popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that
                comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.

                Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than
                mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same
                way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it
                may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.
